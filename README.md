# Break-Out-ball-game

This project Breakout Ball is a Game Development Project. It is developed on the platform named “Unity”.
Breakout Ball is a classic game. In Breakout Ball, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all. The ball moves straight around the screen, bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen. When the brick gets hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. The goal of this game is to break the bricks without missing the ball with your platform.
